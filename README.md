# CLL251_PROJECT
# Enhancing Greenhouse Productivity in India Using Optimized Heat Transfer Techniques

## Project Description
This project explores methods to improve the energy efficiency and temperature stability of greenhouses in India by integrating thermal screens and thermal energy storage (TES) systems. The goal is to create sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable solutions to enhance crop yield and support year-round farming, despite India's diverse climatic challenges.

## Key Features
- Use of thermal screens to minimize nighttime heat loss and stabilize crop temperatures.
- Implementation of thermal energy storage (TES) systems to manage heating and cooling demands efficiently.
- Mathematical modeling using MATLAB to solve heat and mass transfer equations.
- 3D simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics to validate greenhouse thermal behavior.
- Focus on sustainable, low-energy greenhouse farming adapted to Indian climates.

## Results
- Thermal screens reduced internal temperature fluctuations significantly.
- TES systems efficiently balanced heating and cooling needs.
- Maintained optimum crop temperatures between **18°C and 25°C**.
- Peak cooling load: **113 W/m²** during summer; Peak heating load: **59 W/m²** during winter.
- Improved crop yield, reduced energy consumption, and lowered environmental impact.

## Future Work
- Integration with renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind).
- Development of automated climate control systems.
- Application to larger and diverse agro-climatic regions in India.
